# ncerva.portfolio
This portfolio contains some work from the UTSA Coding Bootcamp as well as my work as a graphic designer. 
This portfolio has 3 pages which link together. I am currently creating my brand as a designer to develop a freelance business so my portfolio is a work in progress design wise. I would like to add functionality with Javascript but I am still figuring out what I would like to implement in the site. 

The coding project I feature is my first group project called **Cooking Natural** . The website has the ability to return recipes based on ingredients searched. Feel free to visit the site by clicking on the homepage image!
